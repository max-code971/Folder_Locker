We all have computer files we'd like to protect and keep completely private, but not everyone knows how to password-protect a file folder in Windows 10. Whether you're hiding notes from someone with access to your computer or something less drastic, you're allowed to have some privacy. 

Fortunately, in Windows 10, you can securely protect your private documents or files in a secret folder that is password protected, and you can do it without buying any additional software. Once you've created a new folder in Windows 10, here's how to password-protect it. You can never be too careful when it comes to privacy.
